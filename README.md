# Daily snapshots of San Francisco's 90-day emergency shelter waitlist

This repo contains a compilation of daily snapshots of [San Francisco's shelter reservation wait-list](https://sf311.org/information/waitlist), which I started collecting on [March 12, 2020](data/collected/2020-03-12_13.csv) â€“ around the time when the city was taking action as a result [of health and housing impacts from COVID-19](https://sf.gov/news/san-francisco-responds-coronavirus-new-directives-and-expanded-resources).

**The compiled data**: [data/wrangled/sf-shelter-waitlist.csv](data/wrangled/sf-shelter-waitlist.csv)

## What's in the repo

I run a local cron job that collects the data every day at 8:40PM (CST):

```
40 20 * * * source ~/.bash_profile && cd ~/a/sf-shelter-waitlist/ && ./scripts/collect.py > /dev/null 2>&1 || true
```

The raw daily snapshots can be found in [data/collected](data/collected)


The script [scripts/wrangle.py](scripts/wrangle.py) compiles the snapshots into a single file: [data/wrangled/sf-shelter-waitlist.csv](data/wrangled/sf-shelter-waitlist.csv)
